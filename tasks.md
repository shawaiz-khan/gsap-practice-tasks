### **Most Basic**

1. Animate a box from left to right using `gsap.to()`.
2. Fade in text on page load with `opacity`.
3. Change background color of a div over 2 seconds.
4. Scale a button on hover using `gsap.to()` inside a `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` event.

### **Basic**

1. Animate multiple boxes with a stagger effect.
2. Create a looping bounce effect on an icon.
3. Rotate an element continuously using `repeat: -1`.
4. Animate text coming from the bottom into view (like a title reveal).
5. Animate CSS transform properties like `scale`, `rotate`, and `skew` together.

### **Intermediate**

1. Build a **timeline**: a logo fades in, then slides up, then rotates.
2. Animate elements on **scroll** using `ScrollTrigger`.
3. Create a card hover effect where the card pops out, rotates slightly, and returns.
4. Animate an SVG path using `drawSVG` or `stroke-dasharray`.
5. Animate a modal opening: backdrop fades in, modal scales up.

### **Hard**

1. Full landing page intro animation (logo, navbar, hero text, images all orchestrated with a timeline).
2. Scroll-based parallax effect (foreground moves faster than background).
3. Horizontal scrolling section with pinned content and animated transitions.
4. Complex SVG morphing between two shapes.
5. A fully interactive slider with GSAP animations for entering and exiting slides.
