### **Most Basic**

- [x] Animate a box from left to right using `gsap.to()`.
- [x] Fade in text on page load with `opacity`.
- [x] Change background color of a div over 2 seconds.
- [x] Scale a button on hover using `gsap.to()` inside a `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` event.

### **Basic**

- [x] Animate multiple boxes with a stagger effect.
- [ ] Create a looping bounce effect on an icon.
- [ ] Rotate an element continuously using `repeat: -1`.
- [ ] Animate text coming from the bottom into view (like a title reveal).
- [ ] Animate CSS transform properties like `scale`, `rotate`, and `skew` together.

---

### **Intermediate**

- [ ] Build a **timeline**: a logo fades in, then slides up, then rotates.
- [ ] Animate elements on **scroll** using `ScrollTrigger`.
- [ ] Create a card hover effect where the card pops out, rotates slightly, and returns.
- [ ] Animate an SVG path using `drawSVG` or `stroke-dasharray`.
- [ ] Animate a modal opening: backdrop fades in, modal scales up.

### **Hard**

- [ ] Full landing page intro animation (logo, navbar, hero text, images all orchestrated with a timeline).
- [ ] Scroll-based parallax effect (foreground moves faster than background).
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling section with pinned content and animated transitions.
- [ ] Complex SVG morphing between two shapes.
- [ ] A fully interactive slider with GSAP animations for entering and exiting slides.
